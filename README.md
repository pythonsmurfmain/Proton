# Proton Chatbot ðŸ˜€

Proton Chatbot is an interactive AI-powered application designed to engage in conversations with users. It employs cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand user input and generate relevant responses.

## How It Works âš™

The chatbot's core functionality is built upon a Neural Network architecture. When a user enters a message, the chatbot tokenizes and processes the input using NLTK's text processing tools. The processed input is then fed into the Neural Network, which predicts the most relevant intent for the user query. Based on this prediction, the chatbot selects an appropriate response from a set of predefined responses stored in a JSON file.

## Graphical User Interface ðŸ’»

Proton's user-friendly interface is developed using the Tkinter library. The graphical canvas provides an input field where users can type their messages and an output area where both user queries and chatbot responses are displayed. The interface also features a "Send" button that triggers the chatbot to respond.

## Text-to-Speech Interaction ðŸ”Š

One unique feature of Proton is its ability to audibly communicate its responses to users. This is achieved through the pyttsx3 library, which converts text into speech. When the chatbot generates a response, it is not only displayed in the GUI but also spoken aloud, enhancing the interactive experience.

## Seamless Integration ðŸ“ŠðŸ“‰ðŸ“ˆ

The chatbot's functionalities, including NLP processing, response generation, GUI interaction, and text-to-speech capabilities, are seamlessly integrated to create an engaging and interactive conversation experience.

Proton Chatbot offers a compelling example of how AI and GUI development can be combined to create a dynamic and responsive conversational interface.
